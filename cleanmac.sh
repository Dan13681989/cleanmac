# cleanmac.sh — the actual cleanup/diagnostic tool

echo "[cleanmac] Starting cleanup..."
# ← Put your real cleanup commands here (e.g. rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/*, etc.)
# For demo purposes, we just simulate a task:
sleep 1
echo "[cleanmac] Cleanup complete."

# (You can expand this script with AI-diagnostics, driver checks, etc.)
